# FT857-CAT

Fork from [Philippe F6CZV version](https://github.com/Phil-f6czv/Arduino-FT857-CAT).

## Origial description

A display of some Yaesu FT-857’s parameters was developed for a 4×20 LCD screen. 
The software implements via the serial link the FT-857 CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) controls and additional readings of the transceiver’s EEPROM. 
The developments were made from a source code developed for Arduino by VE3BUX. 
See my web site for more details (https://f6czv.fr)
